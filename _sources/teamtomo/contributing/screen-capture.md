# Screen capture
Having little screen captures can be really useful when trying to explain to someone how to do something! 

We like using [peek](https://github.com/phw/peek) for screen recording.

## Optimising screencasts
It's good practice to try to keep the site lightweight. We use [ezgif](https://ezgif.com/) to both record, recut and optimise our screencasts.

The workflow on their site is:
- video to `.gif`
- recut gif
- optimise gif (usually 150 is a good number)

Then simply save the `.gif` file locally and add it to the repository.
