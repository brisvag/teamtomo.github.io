# About the project

[teamtomo.org](teamtomo.org) was established in an effort to improve the ability of the cryo-ET community to integrate newcomers. 
[#teamtomo](https://twitter.com/hashtag/teamtomo) is often used by members of the Cryo-ET community to share info or ask questions on Twitter.

The project is currently maintained by [Alister Burt](https://twitter.com/AlisterBurt) and [Lorenzo Gaifas](https://twitter.com/brisvag/) from the [Gutsche lab at IBS in Grenoble](https://www.ibs.fr/research/research-groups/microscopic-imaging-of-complex-assemblies-mica-group-i-gutsche/?lang=fr). Use of the `teamtomo.org` domain name is kindly provided by the [Grotjahn lab](https://grotjahnlab.org/). Moving forward, we hope that this project becomes a community endeavour. We plan to de-centralise maintenance as soon as possible, enabling a more open, transparent platform. If you'd like to help out, please do get in touch!
