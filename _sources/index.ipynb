    "[teamtomo.org](https://teamtomo.org) is an *open* and *collaborative* platform for sharing knowledge in the cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) [community](https://twitter.com/hashtag/teamtomo).\n",
    "\n",
    "Cryo-ET is a 3D imaging modality which uses [transmission electron microscopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_electron_microscopy) to image proteins, protein assemblies and thin cellular sections in their native state with high spatial resolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "![3d reconstruction image](assets/3d-reconstruction.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Subtomogram averaging can be used to align and average many copies of the same object, increasing both the signal-to-noise ratio and interpretable resolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're new to cryo-ET and subtomogram averaging, check out this [introduction to Cryo-ET](theory/cryo-et/index) or get hands-on with one of our [data processing walkthroughs](walkthroughs/EMPIAR-10164/introduction.md). Looking for something more specific? Check out of our [mini-tutorials](mini-tutorials/dynamo/index.md) or our [resource pages](resources/literature/index.md)!\n",
    "\n",
    "Still haven't found what you were looking for? Ask the community by sending an email to the [CCP-EM mailing list](https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A0=CCPEM), or use [#teamtomo](https://twitter.com/hashtag/teamtomo) on Twitter.\n",
    "\n",
    "We warmly welcome contributions from anyone willing to share their expertise! If you would like to contribute or suggest some changes, check out our [contribution guidelines](teamtomo/contributing/index).\n",
